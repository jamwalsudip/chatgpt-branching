# ChatGPT Visual Branching Extension - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Problem Statement

ChatGPT currently supports conversation branching through its edit functionality, but this feature is not visually apparent. When users edit a prompt, ChatGPT creates a new branch while preserving the original, but users can only view one branch at a time by clicking arrow buttons. This linear presentation makes it difficult to compare different conversation paths side-by-side.

## 2. Solution Overview

A Chrome extension that modifies ChatGPT's frontend to display conversation branches side-by-side when edits occur, making the branching structure visible and interactive.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Branch Creation
- Add a "Branch" button (fork icon) next to the existing "Edit" button on each message
- When "Branch" is clicked, create a visual branch displaying the original and new conversation paths side-by-side
- The existing "Edit" button maintains its current behavior (no visual branching)

### 3.2 Branch Display
- Show branches side-by-side, similar to ChatGPT's existing two-response comparison layout
- Display up to 3 branches maximum at one time
- Left side: Original prompt and response
- Right side(s): Branched prompt(s) and response(s)

### 3.3 Branch Navigation
- Only one branching point can be expanded at a time
- When a new branching point is expanded, previously expanded branches automatically collapse
- Collapsed branches show a fork icon with a number indicating branch count
- Users can click collapsed branches to expand them again

### 3.4 Message Selection
- Each ChatGPT response displays a "Select" button
- Clicking "Select" marks that response as the active endpoint for new prompts
- The selected branch is visually indicated (grayed out inactive branches)
- New prompts continue from the selected branch's context

### 3.5 Scrolling Behavior
- All visible branches scroll together synchronously
- Messages below the branching point remain visible

## 4. User Interface Requirements

### 4.1 Visual Indicators
- Fork/branch icon for the new "Branch" button
- Fork icon with branch count for collapsed branching points
- Visual distinction between active and inactive branches (graying out)
- "Select" button on each response

### 4.2 Layout
- Maintain ChatGPT's existing design language
- Support both light and dark modes
- Single prompt input box at the bottom (unchanged)

## 5. Feature Priority (MVP)

1. Add Branch button next to Edit button
2. Side-by-side branch display (up to 3)
3. Click to expand/collapse branches
4. Fork icon + branch count on collapsed nodes
5. Gray out inactive branches
6. Branch selection via Select button
7. Synchronized scrolling
8. Auto-collapse parent nodes when expanding others

## 6. Constraints

- Extension must work with ChatGPT's existing branching system
- All branch data is already stored by ChatGPT; extension only provides visual representation
- Desktop Chrome browser only for MVP
- No difference in functionality between ChatGPT Plus and free tiers

## 7. Success Criteria

- Users can visually see and compare different conversation branches
- Users can easily navigate between branches
- Users can continue conversations from any branch
- The extension enhances the existing ChatGPT functionality without breaking it
